# Linkcage: a cage for your links!
  - easily manage (all of) your links from a single simple config file!
  - in nearly pure posix sh!
  -- Additionly there are plans for multifile links!
    - a feature exclusive to linkcage!
# Requires: (ONLY)
  - a posix shell (bash should "count")
  - ln - for creating links
  - `ls -l` || puresh realpath - for readling the realpath of links
  - unlink || rm - for removing your links
---
# Live Update:
 live filesystem updates require daemonizing linkcage
  - init service files are NOT and WILL NOT be provided
   - a pr/issue may exist containing them
   - if not; write one.
---
# Fallback:
  - the following is done if the first util in above required section is missing

 - Live changes detection (typically uses `ls -l`)
  - live changes are detected using $(pshcat) and != (this will be much slower)
    - in the situation that `ls -l` returns data does not match a special case
 - Realpath reading will also make use of `ls -l`
  - falling back to an puresh realpath
    - should `ls -l /dev/null` not match the special case
      - stat can also be used for this purpose 
      - but is not very portable (usage/flag wise) and thus not used
 - symlink removal (typically uses `unlink <link>`)
  - will fallback to rm if `unlink <link>` exits != 0

# Config - an example config can be found at $/ex.conf
   - it also features some information about the multifile links
# Locations: 
  - ./config - highest level config; overrides all
  - /etc/linkcage/config - system config; used if no others are present
  - ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/linkcage/config - user config; used if present
  -- Custom configs; should be provided via STDIN ( linkcage < CONFIG )
