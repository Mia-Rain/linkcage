# Linkcage: a cage for your links!
  - easily manage (all of) your links from a single simple config file!
  - in nearly pure posix sh!
# Requires: (ONLY)
  - a posix shell (bash should "count")
  - ln - for creating links
  - `ls -l` || realpath || readlink - for readling the realpath of links
  - unlink || rm - for removing your links
---
# Live Update:
 live filesystem updates require daemonizing linkcage
  - init service files are NOT and WILL NOT be provided
   - a pr/issue may exist containing them
   - if not; write one.
---
# Fallback:
  - the following is done if the first util in above required section is missing

 - Live changes detection (typically uses `ls -l`)
  - live changes are detected using $(pshcat) and != (this will be much slower)
    - in the situation that `ls -l` returns data does not match a speical case
 - Realpath reading will also make use of `ls -l`
  - falling back to realpath followed by finally readlink
    - should the previous mentioned util exit != 0 
      - stat can also be used for this purpose 
      - but is not very portable (usage/flag wise) and thus not used
 - symlink removal (typically uses `unlink <link>`)
  - will fallback to rm if `unlink <link>` exits != 0
